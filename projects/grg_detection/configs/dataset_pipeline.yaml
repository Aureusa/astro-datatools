CUTOUT_PARAMS:
  CUTOUT_SIZE: 425 # pixels - this gives us 300 pixels after rotation of 45 degrees
  CROP_SIZE: 300 # pixels - final size after rotation and cropping
  RMS: 0.0001

AUGMENTATION:
  STRETCH_TYPE: "sqrt_stretch" # to keep consistency with previous work by Moesterd et al.
  ROTATION_ANGLES: [0, 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270, 315] # degrees
  
  # Limits the number of islands to precompute per cutout.
  # This limits the number of precomputed proposals we get for the RCNN model.
  # The number of proposals is equal to 2^n - 1, where n is the number of islands.
